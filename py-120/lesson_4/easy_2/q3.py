What are the benefits of using object-oriented programming in Python? Think of as many as you can.

1. Group together variables and methods that are conceptually related into objects
2. Classes can inherit methods from other classes
3. We can use other classes as collaborators to abstract away certain functionality into other classes
4. We can instantiate separate instance objects that use the same class yet keep track of different states without
   us having to repeat code
5. We can expose "public interfaces" to other objects, while keeping other methods or instance variables that are meant to be
   "internal use only" to "hide" the functionality behind the scenes


Others include:
6. Helps manage complexity of larger programs
7. It creates containers for data that can be changed without affecting the entire program (sort of related to my #5)
8. We can talk about objects as nouns and their behaviors as verbs
9. Lets programmers think about code at a more abstract level
10. Lets programmers write polymorphic code (that can be used with different kinds of data)
11. Reuse pre-written code to build applications faster
