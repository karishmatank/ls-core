"""
Which of the following are objects in Python? If they are objects, how can you find out what class they belong to?

True
'hello'
[1, 2, 3, 'happy days']
142
{1, 2, 3}
1.2345


I believe these are all objects. We can find their class by calling .__class__ on all of them or using the type() built-in function
EDIT: The terminology is "using the __class__ magic variable"
