/*
Suppose we want to use code to keep track of products in our hardware store's inventory.
A first stab might look something like this:

let scissorsId = 0;
let scissorsName = 'Scissors';
let scissorsStock = 8;
let scissorsPrice = 10;

let drillId = 1;
let drillName = 'Cordless Drill';
let drillStock = 15;
let drillPrice = 45;

This code presents a number of problems, however.
What if we want to add another kind of drill?
Given what we've learned about object orientation in the previous assignment,
how could we use objects to organize these two groups of data?
*/

function inventoryItem(id, name, stock, price) {
  return { id, name, stock, price };
}

let scissors = inventoryItem(0, 'Scissors', 8, 10);
let drill = inventoryItem(1, 'Cordless Drill', 15, 45);


/*
Our new organization also makes it easier to write functions dealing with the products,
because we can now take advantage of conventions in the objects' data.
Create a function that takes one of our product objects as an argument,
and sets the object's price to a non-negative number of our choosing, passed in as a second argument.
If the new price is negative, alert the user that the new price is invalid.
*/

function setPrice(product, newPrice) {
  if (newPrice > 0) {
    product.price = newPrice;
  } else {
    console.log("Price is invalid.");
  }
}

/*
It would also be useful to have the ability to output descriptions of our product objects.
Implement such a function following the example below:

describeProduct(scissors);
// => Name: Scissors
// => ID: 0
// => Price: $10
// => Stock: 8
*/

function describeProduct(product) {
  console.log(`=> Name: ${product.name}`);
  console.log(`=> ID: ${product.id}`);
  console.log(`=> Price: $${product.price}`);
  console.log(`=> Stock: ${product.stock}`);
}

describeProduct(scissors);
// => Name: Scissors
// => ID: 0
// => Price: $10
// => Stock: 8


/*
We want our code to take an object-oriented approach to keeping track of the products,
and although the functions we just wrote work fine, since they are manipulating data in the objects,
we should place them in the objects themselves.
Rewrite the code such that the functions describeProduct and setProductPrice become methods
describe and setPrice on both our scissors and drill objects.
*/

function inventoryItem(id, name, stock, price) {
  return {
    id,
    name,
    stock,
    price,
    describe() {
      console.log(`=> Name: ${this.name}`);
      console.log(`=> ID: ${this.id}`);
      console.log(`=> Price: $${this.price}`);
      console.log(`=> Stock: ${this.stock}`);

    setPrice(newPrice) {
      if (newPrice > 0) {
        this.price = newPrice;
      } else {
        console.log("Price is invalid.");
      }
    }
  };
}

/*
This solution has brought us closer to our object-oriented ideal, but has also introduced some inefficiency,
insofar as our setPrice and describe methods are duplicated in each object, and we will have to type out this code
for each new object we want to create. One solution to this problem is to stop manually creating each object,
 and instead use a factory function to generate them.
 Create a new function createProduct which takes arguments for id, name, stock, and price and also adds
 setPrice and describe to the new object.
*/

/*
I think I basically did this in my answer for the last problem
*/

function createProduct(id, name, stock, price) {
  return {
    id,

        this.price = newPrice;
      } else {
        console.log("Price is invalid.");
      }
    }
  };
}

/*
Finally, remove the scissors and drill object-literal object creations from the code, and
recreate these objects using our createProduct factory function,
along with two or three more products of your choosing.
