/*
The method franchise.allMovies is supposed to return the following array:

[
  'How to Train Your Dragon 1',
  'How to Train Your Dragon 2',
  'How to Train Your Dragon 3'
]

Explain why this method will not return the desired object. Try fixing this problem by taking advantage of JavaScript lexical scoping rules.

/*
Within `allMovies`, the callback function references `this`, but `this` would reference `undefined` in strict mode or the `global` or `window` object in sloppy mode. In other words, it loses its context.

In order to fix this, we have a few options:
- Use an arrow function instead
- Use a local variable inside the `allMovies` method such that the callback closes over that local variable
- Use bind to bind the context to the callback function
- `map` takes in an argument for its `thisArg` parameter

/*
In the previous exercise, we had a situation where an anonymous method passed to map had an undesirable execution context. We solved the problem by taking advantage of lexical scoping and introducing a new variable self. Solve the same problem again by passing a hard-bound anonymous function to map.
